The vijew of the first game is 270x270 but it gets stretched on screen
Need to make a resolution manager so this kind of fucked shit doesn't happen which is a huge pain in the but
Basically means we need to manually manage the camera for each level which can handle drawing black bars etc
Or something
Fucking hate this shit lol

it's a Kim Kubus game that I'm ripping off lol (crash test dummies)
