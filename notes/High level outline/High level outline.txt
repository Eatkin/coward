What to do now:
Fade in/fade out transitions - make them a little bit flickery, some alpha jitter
Make the desk cutscene
Zoom transition

Then we go into Min's game which I have to make lol

The desk:
Has some stuff on it
You click the computer to access things
You can choose forums, game maker or instant messaging (available later)
I'll just show the game Min's making at the moment which will be the maze game
You collect coins or some shit
After 30 seconds he says "Actually the maze has no ending." and the game ends



Here's some ideas about things to explore on the first day:
We look at the Chips Challenge clone the protagonist is making. The graphics can be pillow shaded and bad
Muted sepia tones
Crunchy jpeg compressiono
But the gameplay needn't be bad, becuase I'm making it, I can have some fun juice and shit like that
You play for 30 seconds exploring a maze and then the game ends

We explore the forums, we see a few releases including our friend Keras' shitty game which receives a lot of negative attention

We get a short cutscene discussing Keras
This game is captivating
It cannot be described as anything other than bad, yet, they release it into the world
Nobody seems to like it, but it doesn't seem to bother them
It seems like they are making pure expressionist art
Who is this person?


Some boring stuff:
Disable scrollbars
Resolution management



Random ideas:
Eventually we can visit things like Keras' website to see what they're doing
The desk can change each time and we get a little life catch up
